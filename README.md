# Getting Started

Clone this repository then run **yarn install** from the root of this repository to automatically install the necessary dependencies, which you can also inspect from the *package.json* file. Configure **Expo** and login to your account if you haven't. Then run **yarn start** to start the development server. Your default browser should launch and display a *QR code*. Install the **Expo client** app on your **iOS / Android** device. Scan the *QR code* and the app should launch on your device. Any changes you make to the code will now be reflected on your locally hosted version of the app.
